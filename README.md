# project 

change project file name to mybookrev3 (if there're some errors)

*the project cannot access googledatabase now (For if I keep the json privacy key available in github google will keep sending me alert and suspend the cloud)
In the folder src\main\resources, put the service account key and name it as service-account.json
In the file findrev.py, a rainforest key is needed


Url for the project: 
http://34.68.212.227:9090/home   
(home page, register and login)
After login, you can use search(search isbn and return some reviews) and history (see my search history)
If the data is already in database, it may take shorter time than expected.
Else the program will access external api to get the data.
Also, in history page, click on the button or cover of book can show detail of the book (same as search isbn)
http://34.68.212.227:9090/shows  (Not in the system, just use to see users information store in the database)
